## Introduction

The Image Processing O6U repository is designed to showcase different image processing techniques. It serves as an educational resource and practical demonstration of various operations that can be applied to images. I've created it to help my colleagues to practice more on these codes.

## Code Examples

This repository includes a wide range of code examples, each focusing on a specific image processing technique or operation. Some of the code examples available in this repository are:

- [Section 1 & Section 2](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Image-Processing-O6U/blob/main/Section%201%20%26%20Section%202/main.py): These two sections are focusing on:
  1. How to read, show, and save an image?
  2. Convert from RGB to gray level.
  3. Change the height & width, and also resize the image.
  4. Show the histogram.
- [Section 3](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Image-Processing-O6U/blob/main/Section%203/main.py): This section is focusing on converting an image to util format for applying rules such as:
  1. Linear rule.
  2. Logarithmic rule.
  3. Power (Gamma) rule.
- [Section 4](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Image-Processing-O6U/blob/main/Section%204/main.py): This section is focusing on making some operations such as:
  1. Draw a shape on an image.
  2. Rotation on an image.
  3. Apply convolution and correlation.
- [Section 5](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Image-Processing-O6U/blob/main/Section%205/main.py): This section is focusing on applying filters such as:
  1. Gaussian filter.
  2. Sobel filter.

also, there's an [important](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Image-Processing-O6U/blob/main/Section%205/Important/Important%20links.txt) folder that contains some links that might help to understand these [filters](https://github.com/MuhammedMagdyy/Image-Processing-O6U/blob/main/Section%205/main.py) above.

Feel free to explore each code example's directory.
